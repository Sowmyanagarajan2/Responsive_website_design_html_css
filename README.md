I've created **3 complete HTML/CSS source codes** demonstrating different responsive techniques:

## 📱 **Technique 1: Flexbox Responsive Layout**
- Uses `display: flex` with `flex-wrap` throughout
- Elements automatically reflow based on space
- Features: responsive nav, hero section, card grid, and footer
- Perfect for: Components that need flexible spacing

## 📐 **Technique 2: CSS Grid Responsive Layout**
- Uses `display: grid` with `auto-fit` and `auto-fill`
- Main layout uses `grid-template-areas` for different screen sizes
- Card grid uses `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))` - no media queries needed!
- Advanced gallery with items spanning multiple columns/rows
- Perfect for: Structured layouts and dashboards

## 📱➡️💻 **Technique 3: Media Query Mobile-First Layout**
- Starts with mobile styles, then adds breakpoints at 768px, 1024px, 1440px
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Most control over exact layout at each screen size
- Perfect for: Complex designs needing precise control

## 🎯 Key Differences:

**Flexbox**: Best for one-dimensional layouts (rows OR columns)
**CSS Grid**: Best for two-dimensional layouts (rows AND columns)
**Media Queries**: Best for complete layout transformations

**Try resizing your browser** on each example to see how they respond differently! Each technique has its strengths - modern sites often combine all three.
